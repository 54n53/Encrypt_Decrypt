This repository contains 2 python files, Encrypt.py and Decrypt.py.
Encrypt.py: encrypts all files from the path you specify as input parameter. Displays the encryption key on screen.
Decrypt.py: decrypts all files from the specified path as long as the encryption key is present.

Future improvements: Encrypt the password with your public key and only decrypt it with the private key, so that it would be useless to intercept it.
Another point is to send the encryption key encrypted with the public key to another listening ip.
